                     # Number of real adapters installed in your system

                     # Maximum is 4 because max 8 adapters are permitted in your system.
                     # (4 real + 4 loopback) If you need more, like me, recompile your kernel.
                     # So if you have 2 adapters, you need to set "-j a:c -j b:d" in JOIN=" "

                     # The first two of them are in use with Tvheadend or some other program
                     # Number 3, 4 and 5 will be used by MythTV
